/*

In a Production Vercel Environment (Serverless):

##Cold Start: 
A request comes in, and Vercel needs to spin up a new serverless function instance.
This is a fresh Node.js process.

=> global.mongoose is undefined. (see index.d.ts for type declaration)
=> !cached is true.
=> The if (!cached) block executes, initializes the cache, and creates the database connection promise.

##Warm Start: Another request comes in shortly after, and Vercel reuses the same running instance.

=> This is like a "hot reload" â€“ the process is still alive.
=> global.mongoose still holds the cached object.
=> !cached is false.
=> The if (!cached) block is skipped, and the rest of the function reuses the existing connection promise or established connection.


This is the entire point of the strategy:
=> Connect once per instance
=> euse that connection for all subsequent requests handled by that warm instance.

    // The other requests see that a connection is already in progress (cached.promise exists) and simply wait for it to complete,
